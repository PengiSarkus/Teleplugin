# ✨ TelePlugin - Teleport Without OP Permissions

**TelePlugin** is a lightweight and user-friendly Minecraft plugin that allows players to teleport to each other **without needing OP permissions**. Perfect for survival servers, communities, or any setup where you'd like to offer safe and fair teleportation without giving away admin rights.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Teleportation **without OP**
- 💬 Simple and intuitive commands: `/tp` and `/isinlan`
- ⚙️ Easy to configure (permissions, cooldowns, messages)

## 🧪 Still in Development

> ⚠️ This plugin is currently under development. There's no compiled `.jar` file yet — stay tuned!

## 🛠 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/tp <player>` | Sends a teleport request to another player |
| `/isinlan <player>` | An alternative teleport command (localized for Turkish users) |

*Both commands do the same thing — just two different ways to say “teleport” depending on your player base

TelePlugin will give all players access by default — no OP required.

## ⚙️ Configuration (Planned)

The plugin will offer a `config.yml` file to let you customize:
- Cooldown time between teleport requests
- Custom messages (localized support)
- Request timeout duration

## 📌 Future Plans

- Region-based teleport restrictions
- Cool particle/sound effects on teleport
- Group teleport or teleport to spawn/home support
